# Aitch

Aitch (or Haitch depending on your region) is a pragmatic HTML templating library for Go. It takes inspiration from the JavaScript framework Mithril which in turn takes inspiration from hyperscript. Unlike traditional templating engines, Aitch and other hyperscript-like libraries produce HTML through nested functions.

## Requirements

- Go 1.18

## Installation

```
go get github.com/leviceccato/aitch
```
